Introduction to Conversational Context: Session, State, and Memory¶
Supported in ADKPythonGoJava
Meaningful, multi-turn conversations require agents to understand context. Just like humans, they need to recall the conversation history: what's been said and done to maintain continuity and avoid repetition. The Agent Development Kit (ADK) provides structured ways to manage this context through Session, State, and Memory.

Core Concepts¶
Think of different instances of your conversations with the agent as distinct conversation threads, potentially drawing upon long-term knowledge.

Session: The Current Conversation Thread

Represents a single, ongoing interaction between a user and your agent system.
Contains the chronological sequence of messages and actions taken by the agent (referred to Events) during that specific interaction.
A Session can also hold temporary data (State) relevant only during this conversation.
State (session.state): Data Within the Current Conversation

Data stored within a specific Session.
Used to manage information relevant only to the current, active conversation thread (e.g., items in a shopping cart during this chat, user preferences mentioned in this session).
Memory: Searchable, Cross-Session Information

Represents a store of information that might span multiple past sessions or include external data sources.
It acts as a knowledge base the agent can search to recall information or context beyond the immediate conversation.
Managing Context: Services¶
ADK provides services to manage these concepts:

SessionService: Manages the different conversation threads (Session objects)

Handles the lifecycle: creating, retrieving, updating (appending Events, modifying State), and deleting individual Sessions.
MemoryService: Manages the Long-Term Knowledge Store (Memory)

Handles ingesting information (often from completed Sessions) into the long-term store.
Provides methods to search this stored knowledge based on queries.
Implementations: ADK offers different implementations for both SessionService and MemoryService, allowing you to choose the storage backend that best fits your application's needs. Notably, in-memory implementations are provided for both services; these are designed specifically for local testing and fast development. It's important to remember that all data stored using these in-memory options (sessions, state, or long-term knowledge) is lost when your application restarts. For persistence and scalability beyond local testing, ADK also offers cloud-based and database service options.

In Summary:

Session & State: Focus on the current interaction – the history and data of the single, active conversation. Managed primarily by a SessionService.
Memory: Focuses on the past and external information – a searchable archive potentially spanning across conversations. Managed by a MemoryService.
What's Next?¶
In the following sections, we'll dive deeper into each of these components:

Session: Understanding its structure and Events.
State: How to effectively read, write, and manage session-specific data.
SessionService: Choosing the right storage backend for your sessions.
MemoryService: Exploring options for storing and retrieving broader context.
Understanding these concepts is fundamental to building agents that can engage in complex, stateful, and context-aware conversations.
