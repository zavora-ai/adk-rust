User Simulation¶
Supported in ADKPython v1.18.0
When evaluating conversational agents, it is not always practical to use a fixed set of user prompts, as the conversation can proceed in unexpected ways. For example, if the agent needs the user to supply two values to perform a task, it may ask for those values one at a time or both at once. To resolve this issue, ADK can dynamically generate user prompts using a generative AI model.

To use this feature, you must specify a ConversationScenario which dictates the user's goals in their conversation with the agent. A sample conversation scenario for the hello_world agent is shown below:


{
  "starting_prompt": "What can you do for me?",
  "conversation_plan": "Ask the agent to roll a 20-sided die. After you get the result, ask the agent to check if it is prime."
}
The starting_prompt in a conversation scenario specifies a fixed initial prompt that the user should use to start the conversation with the agent. Specifying such fixed prompts for subsequent interactions with the agent is not practical as the agent may respond in different ways. Instead, the conversation_plan provides a guideline for how the rest of the conversation with the agent should proceed. An LLM uses this conversation plan, along with the conversation history, to dynamically generate user prompts until it judges that the conversation is complete.

Try it in Colab

Test this entire workflow yourself in an interactive notebook on Simulating User Conversations to Dynamically Evaluate ADK Agents. You'll define a conversation scenario, run a "dry run" to check the dialogue, and then perform a full evaluation to score the agent's responses.

Example: Evaluating the hello_world agent with conversation scenarios¶
To add evaluation cases containing conversation scenarios to a new or existing EvalSet, you need to first create a list of conversation scenarios to test the agent in.

Try saving the following to contributing/samples/hello_world/conversation_scenarios.json:


{
  "scenarios": [
    {
      "starting_prompt": "What can you do for me?",
      "conversation_plan": "Ask the agent to roll a 20-sided die. After you get the result, ask the agent to check if it is prime."
    },
    {
      "starting_prompt": "Hi, I'm running a tabletop RPG in which prime numbers are bad!",
      "conversation_plan": "Say that you don't care about the value; you just want the agent to tell you if a roll is good or bad. Once the agent agrees, ask it to roll a 6-sided die. Finally, ask the agent to do the same with 2 20-sided dice."
    }
  ]
}
You will also need a session input file containing information used during evaluation. Try saving the following to contributing/samples/hello_world/session_input.json:


{
  "app_name": "hello_world",
  "user_id": "user"
}
Then, you can add the conversation scenarios to an EvalSet:


# (optional) create a new EvalSet
adk eval_set create \
  contributing/samples/hello_world \
  eval_set_with_scenarios

# add conversation scenarios to the EvalSet as new eval cases
adk eval_set add_eval_case \
  contributing/samples/hello_world \
  eval_set_with_scenarios \
  --scenarios_file contributing/samples/hello_world/conversation_scenarios.json \
  --session_input_file contributing/samples/hello_world/session_input.json
By default, ADK runs evaluations with metrics that require the agent's expected response to be specified. Since that is not the case for a dynamic conversation scenario, we will use an EvalConfig with some alternate supported metrics.

Try saving the following to contributing/samples/hello_world/eval_config.json:


{
  "criteria": {
    "hallucinations_v1": {
      "threshold": 0.5,
      "evaluate_intermediate_nl_responses": true
    },
    "safety_v1": {
      "threshold": 0.8
    }
  }
}
Finally, you can use the adk eval command to run the evaluation:


adk eval \
    contributing/samples/hello_world \
    --config_file_path contributing/samples/hello_world/eval_config.json \
    eval_set_with_scenarios \
    --print_detailed_results
User simulator configuration¶
You can override the default user simulator configuration to change the model, internal model behavior, and the maximum number of user-agent interactions. The below EvalConfig shows the default user simulator configuration:


{
  "criteria": {
    # same as before
  },
  "user_simulator_config": {
    "model": "gemini-2.5-flash",
    "model_configuration": {
      "thinking_config": {
        "include_thoughts": true,
        "thinking_budget": 10240
      }
    },
    "max_allowed_invocations": 20
  }
}
model: The model backing the user simulator.
model_configuration: A GenerateContentConfig which controls the model behavior.
max_allowed_invocations: The maximum user-agent interactions allowed before the conversation is forcefully terminated. This should be set to be greater than the longest reasonable user-agent interaction in your EvalSet.
