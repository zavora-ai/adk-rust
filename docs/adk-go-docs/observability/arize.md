Agent Observability with Arize AX¶
Arize AX is a production-grade observability platform for monitoring, debugging, and improving LLM applications and AI Agents at scale. It provides comprehensive tracing, evaluation, and monitoring capabilities for your Google ADK applications. To get started, sign up for a free account.

For an open-source, self-hosted alternative, check out Phoenix.

Overview¶
Arize AX can automatically collect traces from Google ADK using OpenInference instrumentation, allowing you to:

Trace agent interactions - Automatically capture every agent run, tool call, model request, and response with context and metadata
Evaluate performance - Assess agent behavior using custom or pre-built evaluators and run experiments to test agent configurations
Monitor in production - Set up real-time dashboards and alerts to track performance
Debug issues - Analyze detailed traces to quickly identify bottlenecks, failed tool calls, and any unexpected agent behavior
Agent Traces

Installation¶
Install the required packages:


pip install openinference-instrumentation-google-adk google-adk arize-otel
Setup¶
1. Configure Environment Variables¶
Set your Google API key:


export GOOGLE_API_KEY=[your_key_here]
2. Connect your application to Arize AX¶

from arize.otel import register

# Register with Arize AX
tracer_provider = register(
    space_id="your-space-id",      # Found in app space settings page
    api_key="your-api-key",        # Found in app space settings page
    project_name="your-project-name"  # Name this whatever you prefer
)

# Import and configure the automatic instrumentor from OpenInference
from openinference.instrumentation.google_adk import GoogleADKInstrumentor

# Finish automatic instrumentation
GoogleADKInstrumentor().instrument(tracer_provider=tracer_provider)
Observe¶
Now that you have tracing setup, all Google ADK SDK requests will be streamed to Arize AX for observability and evaluation.
