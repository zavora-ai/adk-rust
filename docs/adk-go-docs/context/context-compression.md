Compress agent context for performance¶
Supported in ADKPython v1.16.0
As an ADK agent runs it collects context information, including user instructions, retrieved data, tool responses, and generated content. As the size of this context data grows, agent processing times typically also increase. More and more data is sent to the generative AI model used by the agent, increasing processing time and slowing down responses. The ADK Context Compaction feature is designed to reduce the size of context as an agent is running by summarizing older parts of the agent workflow event history.

The Context Compaction feature uses a sliding window approach for collecting and summarizing agent workflow event data within a Session. When you configure this feature in your agent, it summarizes data from older events once it reaches a threshold of a specific number of workflow events, or invocations, with the current Session.

Configure context compaction¶
Add context compaction to your agent workflow by adding an Events Compaction Configuration setting to the App object of your workflow. As part of the configuration, you must specify a compaction interval and overlap size, as shown in the following sample code:


from google.adk.apps.app import App
from google.adk.apps.app import EventsCompactionConfig

app = App(
    name='my-agent',
    root_agent=root_agent,
    events_compaction_config=EventsCompactionConfig(
        compaction_interval=3,  # Trigger compaction every 3 new invocations.
        overlap_size=1          # Include last invocation from the previous window.
    ),
)
Once configured, the ADK Runner handles the compaction process in the background each time the session reaches the interval.

Example of context compaction¶
If you set compaction_interval to 3 and overlap_size to 1, the event data is compressed upon completion of events 3, 6, 9, and so on. The overlap setting increases size of the second summary compression, and each summary afterwards, as shown in Figure 1.

Context compaction example illustration Figure 1. Ilustration of event compaction configuration with a interval of 3 and overlap of 1.

With this example configuration, the context compression tasks happen as follows:

Event 3 completes: All 3 events are compressed into a summary
Event 6 completes: Events 3 to 6 are compressed, including the overlap of 1 prior event
Event 9 completes: Events 6 to 9 are compressed, including the overlap of 1 prior event
Configuration settings¶
The configuration settings for this feature control how frequently event data is compressed and how much data is retained as the agent workflow runs. Optionally, you can configure a compactor object

compaction_interval: Set the number of completed events that triggers compaction of the prior event data.
overlap_size: Set how many of the previously compacted events are included in a newly compacted context set.
compactor: (Optional) Define a compactor object including a specific AI model to use for summarization. For more information, see Define a compactor.
Define a Summarizer¶
You can customize the process of context compression by defining a summarizer. The LlmEventSummarizer class allows you to specify a particular model for summarization. The following code example demonstrates how to define and configure a custom summarizer:


from google.adk.apps.app import App, EventsCompactionConfig
from google.adk.apps.llm_event_summarizer import LlmEventSummarizer
from google.adk.models import Gemini

# Define the AI model to be used for summarization:
summarization_llm = Gemini(model="gemini-2.5-flash")

# Create the summarizer with the custom model:
my_summarizer = LlmEventSummarizer(llm=summarization_llm)

# Configure the App with the custom summarizer and compaction settings:
app = App(
    name='my-agent',
    root_agent=root_agent,
    events_compaction_config=EventsCompactionConfig(
        summarizer=my_summarizer,
        compaction_interval=3,
        overlap_size=1
    ),
)
You can further refine the operation of the SlidingWindowCompactor by by modifying its summarizer class LlmEventSummarizer including changing the prompt_template setting of that class. For more details, see the LlmEventSummarizer code.
