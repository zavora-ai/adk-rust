ADK with Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol¶
Supported in ADKPythonGoExperimental
With Agent Development Kit (ADK), you can build complex multi-agent systems where different agents need to collaborate and interact using Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol! This section provides a comprehensive guide to building powerful multi-agent systems where agents can communicate and collaborate securely and efficiently.

Navigate through the guides below to learn about ADK's A2A capabilities:

Introduction to A2A

Start here to learn the fundamentals of A2A by building a multi-agent system with a root agent, a local sub-agent, and a remote A2A agent. The following guides cover how do I expose your agent so that other agents can use it via the A2A protocol:
