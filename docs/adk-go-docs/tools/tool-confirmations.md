Get action confirmation for ADK Tools¶
Supported in ADKPython v1.14.0Experimental
Some agent workflows require confirmation for decision making, verification, security, or general oversight. In these cases, you want to get a response from a human or supervising system before proceeding with a workflow. The Tool Confirmation feature in the Agent Development Kit (ADK) allows an ADK Tool to pause its execution and interact with a user or other system for confirmation or to gather structured data before proceeding. You can use Tool Confirmation with an ADK Tool in the following ways:

Boolean Confirmation: You can configure a FunctionTool with a require_confirmation parameter. This option pauses the tool for a yes or no confirmation response.
Advanced Confirmation: For scenarios requiring structured data responses, you can configure a FunctionTool with a text prompt to explain the confirmation and an expected response.
Experimental

The Tool Confirmation feature is experimental and has some known limitations. We welcome your feedback!

You can configure how a request is communicated to a user, and the system can also use remote responses sent via the ADK server's REST API. When using the confirmation feature with the ADK web user interface, the agent workflow displays a dialog box to the user to request input, as shown in Figure 1:

The following sections describe how to use this feature for the confirmation scenarios. For a complete code sample, see the human_tool_confirmation example. There are additional ways to incorporate human input into your agent workflow, for more details, see the Human-in-the-loop agent pattern.

Boolean confirmation¶
When your tool only requires a simple yes or no from the user, you can append a confirmation step using the FunctionTool class as a wrapper. For example, if you have a tool called reimburse, you can enable a confirmation step by wrapping it with the FunctionTool class and setting the require_confirmation parameter to True, as shown in the following example:


# From agent.py
root_agent = Agent(
   ...
   tools=[
        # Set require_confirmation to True to require user confirmation
        # for the tool call.
        FunctionTool(reimburse, require_confirmation=True),
    ],
...
This implementation method requires minimal code, but is limited to simple approvals from the user or confirming system. For a complete example of this approach, see the human_tool_confirmation code sample.

Require confirmation function¶
You can modify the behavior require_confirmation response by replacing its input value with a function that returns a boolean response. The following example shows a function for determining if a confirmation is required:


async def confirmation_threshold(
    amount: int, tool_context: ToolContext
) -> bool:
  """Returns true if the amount is greater than 1000."""
  return amount > 1000
This function than then be set as the parameter value for the require_confirmation parameter:


root_agent = Agent(
   ...
   tools=[
        # Set require_confirmation to True to require user confirmation
        FunctionTool(reimburse, require_confirmation=confirmation_threshold),
    ],
...
For a complete example of this implementation, see the human_tool_confirmation code sample.

Advanced confirmation¶
When a tool confirmation requires more details for the user or a more complex response, use a tool_confirmation implementation. This approach extends the ToolContext object to add a text description of the request for the user and allows for more complex response data. When implementing tool confirmation this way, you can pause a tool's execution, request specific information, and then resume the tool with the provided data.

This confirmation flow has a request stage where the system assembles and sends an input request human response, and a response stage where the system receives and processes the returned data.

Confirmation definition¶
When creating a Tool with an advanced confirmation, create a function that includes a ToolContext object. Then define the confirmation using a tool_confirmation object, the tool_context.request_confirmation() method with hint and payload parameters. These properties are used as follows:

hint: Descriptive message that explains what is needed from the user.
payload: The structure of the data you expect in return. This data type is Any and must be serializable into a JSON-formatted string, such as a dictionary or pydantic model.
The following code shows an example implementation for a tool that processes time off requests for an employee:


def request_time_off(days: int, tool_context: ToolContext):
  """Request day off for the employee."""
  ...
  tool_confirmation = tool_context.tool_confirmation
  if not tool_confirmation:
    tool_context.request_confirmation(
        hint=(
            'Please approve or reject the tool call request_time_off() by'
            ' responding with a FunctionResponse with an expected'
            ' ToolConfirmation payload.'
        ),
        payload={
            'approved_days': 0,
        },
    )
    # Return intermediate status indicating that the tool is waiting for
    # a confirmation response:
    return {'status': 'Manager approval is required.'}

  approved_days = tool_confirmation.payload['approved_days']
  approved_days = min(approved_days, days)
  if approved_days == 0:
    return {'status': 'The time off request is rejected.', 'approved_days': 0}
  return {
      'status': 'ok',
      'approved_days': approved_days,
  }
For a complete example of this approach, see the human_tool_confirmation code sample. Keep in mind that the agent workflow tool execution pauses while a confirmation is obtained. After confirmation is received, you can access the confirmation response in the tool_confirmation.payload object and then proceed with the execution of the workflow.

Remote confirmation with REST API¶
If there is no active user interface for a human confirmation of an agent workflow, you can handle the confirmation through a command-line interface or by routing it through another channel like email or a chat application. To confirm the tool call, the user or calling application needs to send a FunctionResponse event with the tool confirmation data.

You can send the request to the ADK API server's /run or /run_sse endpoint, or directly to the ADK runner. The following example uses a curl command to send the confirmation to the /run_sse endpoint:


 curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/run_sse \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{
    "app_name": "human_tool_confirmation",
    "user_id": "user",
    "session_id": "7828f575-2402-489f-8079-74ea95b6a300",
    "new_message": {
        "parts": [
            {
                "function_response": {
                    "id": "adk-13b84a8c-c95c-4d66-b006-d72b30447e35",
                    "name": "adk_request_confirmation",
                    "response": {
                        "confirmed": true
                    }
                }
            }
        ],
        "role": "user"
    }
}'
A REST-based response for a confirmation must meet the following requirements:

The id in the function_response should match the function_call_id from the RequestConfirmation FunctionCall event.
The name should be adk_request_confirmation.
The response object contains the confirmation status and any additional payload data required by the tool.
Note: Confirmation with Resume feature

If your ADK agent workflow is configured with the Resume feature, you also must include the Invocation ID (invocation_id) parameter with the confirmation response. The Invocation ID you provide must be the same invocation that generated the confirmation request, otherwise the system starts a new invocation with the confirmation response. If your agent uses the Resume feature, consider including the Invocation ID as a parameter with your confirmation request, so it can be included with the response. For more details on using the Resume feature, see Resume stopped agents.
