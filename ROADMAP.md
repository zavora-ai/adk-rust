# ADK-Rust Roadmap

> **Last updated:** June 2026
>
> ADK-Rust aims to become the best Rust-native platform for building, orchestrating, and deploying production AI agents across cloud, edge, enterprise, and emerging spatial environments.

## Vision

We believe AGI is intelligent orchestration: specialist capabilities working together, strong runtime foundations, secure deployment, transparent control planes, and adaptive execution across different environments.

By the end of 2026, an AI Agent built with ADK-Rust will have:

- Native agentic capabilities covering full vision, audio, software-as-tools, and feature parity with leading frameworks
- Autonomous mode and feature parity with open-source autonomous agents
- Secure internally and externally on all surfaces for enterprises
- Fully transparent control plane
- Physical/spatial capabilities
- Mature developer tools

## Two Orchestration APIs, Both Supported

ADK-Rust keeps the workflow agents (`SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`,
`LoopAgent`) **and** `adk-graph`. Neither supersedes the other, and neither is
deprecated.

| | Workflow agents | `adk-graph` |
|---|---|---|
| Topology | Implied by the list of sub-agents | Declared as nodes and edges |
| Control flow | Fixed when written | May depend on results at run time |
| Durability | None beyond the session | Checkpointed per super-step |
| Cost to adopt | One constructor | A state schema and a compile step |

They compose in both directions: a workflow agent is an `AgentNode`, and
`GraphAgent` is an `Agent` a workflow agent can hold. Tests in
`adk-graph/tests/trio_composition_tests.rs` pin both, so neither API can become
something the other cannot carry.

This is a deliberate divergence from the other ADK implementations, where the
classic orchestrators are deprecated in favour of a workflow engine. Short linear
pipelines are common, and requiring a graph for them costs more than it returns.

## Benchmark Results (June 2026)

Real measurements against `gemini-2.5-flash`:

| Framework | Cold Start | Loop Overhead | Peak RSS |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| **ADK-Rust** | **109 ms** | **568 μs** | ~15 MB |
| Gemini Python SDK | 501 ms | 253 μs | 69.7 MB |
| LangGraph | 502 ms | 1,228 ms | 92.7 MB |

Run `cargo adk bench --confirm-cost` to reproduce.
